As an Intern, I have created and completed within 13-14 days a JavaScript Interactivity as per the task of MainFlow (FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT) ----TASK 2.
Task Description:
Enhance the previously created webpage by adding interactive elements using JavaScript. Implement a contact form with form validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly. Create a simple image slideshow or toggle button to change content dynamically on the page.
